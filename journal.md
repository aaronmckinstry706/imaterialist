# Journal for iMaterialist Competition

## Mar. 16, 2018

I'm setting out some goals for this weekend. First: download the URLs. Second: write a Python script to download all the individual URLs and organize it so that it is easily consumable by Pytorch. Off to download the URLs. 

Downloaded the URLs, and loaded them using Python's `json` module. Next step: writing script to download all the images with their corresponding labels.
